> [!CAUTION]
> **LLM/AI Disclaimer:** Large Language Models (LLMs) such as those used by this module do not possess intelligence, reasoning, or true understanding. They generate text by predicting the most likely next word based on patterns in their training data—matching vectors, not thinking or comprehension. The quality and relevance of responses depend entirely on the model you use, its training data, and its configuration. Results may vary, and sometimes the output may be irrelevant, nonsensical, or simply not work as expected. This is a fundamental limitation of current AI and LLM technology. Use with realistic expectations.

> This module is also in development and can bog down your server due to the nature of running local LLM. Please proceed with this in mind.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To fully disable Playerbots normal chatter and random chatter that might interfere with this module, set the following settings in your `playerbots.conf`:
> - `AiPlayerbot.EnableBroadcasts = 0` (disables loot/quest/kill broadcasts)
> - `AiPlayerbot.RandomBotTalk = 0` (disables random talking in say/yell/general channels)
> - `AiPlayerbot.RandomBotEmote = 0` (disables random emoting)

## Overview

***mod-ollama-chat*** is an AzerothCore module that enhances the Player Bots module by integrating external language model (LLM) support via the Ollama API. This module enables player bots to generate dynamic, in-character chat responses using advanced natural language processing locally on your computer (or remotely hosted). Bots are enriched with personality traits, random chatter triggers, and context-aware replies that mimic the language and lore of World of Warcraft.

## Features

- **Ollama LLM Integration:**  
  Bots generate chat responses by querying an external Ollama API endpoint. This enables natural and contextually appropriate in-game dialogue.

- **Player Bot Personalities:**  
  When enabled, each bot is assigned a personality type (e.g., Gamer, Roleplayer, Trickster) that modifies its chat style. Personalities influence prompt generation and result in varied, immersive responses.

- **Context-Aware Prompt Generation:**  
  The module gathers extensive context about both the bot and the interacting player—including class, race, role, faction, guild, and more—to generate prompts for the LLM. A comprehensive WoW cheat sheet is appended to every prompt to ensure the LLM replies with accurate lore, terminology, and in-character language spanning Vanilla WoW, The Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King.

- **Random Chatter:**  
  Bots can periodically initiate random, environment-based chat when a real player is nearby. This feature adds an extra layer of immersion to the game world.

- **Chat Memory (Conversation History):**  
  Bots now have configurable short-term chat memory. Recent conversations between each player and bot are stored and included as context in every LLM prompt, giving responses better context and continuity.

  Bots now recall your recent interactions—responses will reflect the last several lines of chat with each player.

- **Blacklist for Playerbot Commands:**  
  A configurable blacklist prevents bots from responding to chat messages that start with common playerbot command prefixes, ensuring that administrative commands are not inadvertently processed. Additional commands can be appended via the configuration.

- **Asynchronous Response Handling:**  
  Chat responses are generated on separate threads to avoid blocking the main server loop, ensuring smooth server performance.

- **Live Configuration & Personality Reload:**  
  Reload the module’s config and personality packs in-game or from the server console, without restarting.

- **Event-Based Chatter:**  
  Player bots now comment on key in-game events such as quest completion, rare loot, deaths, PvP kills, leveling up, duels, learning spells, and achievements. Remarks are context-aware, immersive, and personality-driven, making the world feel much more alive.

- **Party-Only Bot Responses:**  
  When enabled, bots will only respond to real player messages and events when they are in the same non-raid party. This helps reduce chat spam while maintaining full bot-to-bot communication within parties for immersive group interactions.

- **Think Mode Support:**  
  Bots can leverage LLM models that have reasoning/think modes. Enable internal reasoning for models that support it by setting `OllamaChat.ThinkModeEnableForModule = 1` in **mod-ollama-chat.conf**. When enabled, the API request includes the `think` flag and the bot omits all `thinking` responses from its final reply.

- **Live Reload for Personalities and Settings:**  
  Instantly reload all mod-ollama-chat configuration and personality packs in-game using the `.ollama reload` command with a GM level account or use `ollama reload` from the server console. No server restart required—updates to `.conf` or personality packs (`.sql` files) are applied immediately.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cross-Platform Support**: This module now uses cpp-httplib (header-only) instead of curl, eliminating compilation issues on Windows and simplifying installation on all platforms.

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have liyunfan1223's AzerothCore (https://github.com/liyunfan1223/azerothcore-wotlk) installation with the Player Bots (https://github.com/liyunfan1223/mod-playerbots) module enabled.
   - The module depends on:
     - **fmtlib** (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) - For string formatting
     - **nlohmann/json** (https://github.com/nlohmann/json) - For JSON processing (**bundled with module** - no installation needed)
     - cpp-httplib (https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) - Header-only HTTP library (included, no installation needed)
     - Ollama LLM support – set up a local instance of the Ollama API server with the model of your choice. More details at https://ollama.com

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ### Windows (vcpkg):
   ```bash
   vcpkg install fmt
   ```

   ### Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libfmt-dev
   ```

   ### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install fmt-devel  # or dnf install fmt-devel
   ```

   ### macOS (Homebrew):
   ```bash
   brew install fmt
   ```

   ### Arch Linux:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S fmt
   ```

3. **Clone the Module:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules
   git clone https://github.com/DustinHendrickson/mod-ollama-chat.git
   ```

4. **Recompile AzerothCore:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/azerothcore
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

5. **Configuration:**
   Copy the default configuration file to your server configuration directory and change to match your setup (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/azerothcore/modules/mod-ollama-chat/mod-ollama-chat.conf.dist /path/to/azerothcore/etc/config/mod-ollama-chat.conf
   ```

6. **Restart the Server:**
   ```bash
   ./worldserver
   ```

## Setting up Ollama Server

This module requires a running Ollama server to function. Ollama allows you to run large language models locally on your machine.

### Installing Ollama

Download and install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com). It supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Windows/macOS:** Download the installer from the website and run it.
- **Linux:** Follow the installation instructions for your distribution (e.g., `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`).

### Starting the Ollama Server

Once installed, start the Ollama server:

```bash
ollama serve
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:11434` by default.

### Running Ollama Across the Network

If you want to run the Ollama server on a different computer than your AzerothCore server, set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to `0.0.0.0` before starting the server:

```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0
ollama serve
```

This binds the server to all network interfaces, allowing connections from other machines on your network. Update the `OllamaChat.ApiEndpoint` in `mod-ollama-chat.conf` to use the IP address of the machine running Ollama (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:11434`).

> [!WARNING]
> Exposing Ollama to the network may pose security risks. Ensure your firewall allows traffic on port 11434 only from trusted networks, and consider additional security measures if exposing to the internet.

### Pulling a Model

Before using the module, pull a model that the bots will use for generating responses. For example, to pull the Llama 3.2 1B model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

You can find available models at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library). Choose a model that fits your hardware capabilities.

### Connecting the Module

The module connects to the Ollama API via the configuration in `mod-ollama-chat.conf`. The default endpoint is `http://localhost:11434`. If your Ollama server is running on a different host or port, update the `OllamaChat.ApiEndpoint` setting.

### Checking if Ollama is Running

To verify that the Ollama server is running and accessible, you can test the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

This should return a JSON response listing available models. If you get a connection error, ensure the server is started and the endpoint is correct.

## Configuration Options

> For a complete list of all available configuration options with comments and defaults, see `mod-ollama-chat.conf.dist` included in this repository.

## Text Commands

The module provides several in-game text commands for administrators (Game Masters) to manage and monitor the Ollama chat functionality. All commands require **SEC_ADMINISTRATOR** security level (GM level 3 or higher).

## How It Works

1. **Chat Filtering and Triggering**  
   When a player (or bot) sends a chat message, the module checks the message's type, distance, and if it starts with any configured blacklist command prefix. If party restrictions are enabled, only bots in the same non-raid party as the real player can respond. Only eligible messages in range and not matching the blacklist will trigger a bot response.

2. **Bot Selection**  
   The system gathers all bots within the relevant distance, determines eligibility based on player/bot reply chance, and caps responses per message using `MaxBotsToPick` and related settings.

3. **Prompt Assembly**  
   For each reply, a prompt is assembled by combining configurable templates with live in-game context: bot/player class, race, gender, role/spec, faction, guild, level, zone, gold, group, environment info, personality, and if enabled, recent chat history between that player and the bot.

4. **LLM Request**  
   The prompt is sent to the Ollama API using the configured model and parameters. All LLM requests run asynchronously, ensuring no lag or blocking of the server.

5. **Response Routing**  
   Bot responses are routed back through the appropriate chat channel in game, whether it’s say, yell, party or general.

6. **Personality Management**  
   If RP personalities are enabled, each bot uses its assigned personality template. Personality definitions can be changed on the fly and reloaded live—no server restart required.

7. **Random & Event-Based Chatter**  
   In addition to responding to direct chat, bots will occasionally generate random environment-aware lines when real players are nearby, and will also react to key in-game events (e.g., PvP/PvE kills, loot, deaths, quests, duels, level-ups, achievements, using objects) using context-specific templates and personalities.

8. **Live Reloading**  
   You can hot-reload the module config and personality packs in-game using the `.ollama reload` GM command or from the server console. All changes take effect immediately without requiring a restart.

9. **Fully Configurable**  
   All settings—reply logic, distances, frequencies, blacklist, prompt templates, chat history, personalities, random/event chatter, LLM params, and more—are controlled via `mod-ollama-chat.conf` and can be adjusted and reloaded live at any time.

## Personality Packs

`mod-ollama-chat` supports Personality Packs, which are collections of personality templates that define how bots roleplay and interact in-game.

- To use a Personality Pack, download or create a `.sql` file named in the format `YYYY_MM_DD_personality_pack_NAME.sql`.

- Place the `.sql` file in `modules/mod-ollama-chat/data/sql/characters/updates/`.

- The module will automatically detect and apply any new Personality Packs when the server starts or updates—no manual SQL import required.
